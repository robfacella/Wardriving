Over time I have gathered an enourmous amount of data, which I have yet to process.
What's the point of collecting data if you never use it for anything? I reference my maps from time to time, just to use the data as a talking point; yet numerous applications can be used to distill usable information from all of this data.

The wiGLE Database contains table entries for each device I've scanned, should have columns such as:
Network Name  (SSID)
MAC Address   (BSSID)
Security Type (WPA2/WPA/WEP)
Network Type  (WiFi/BlueTooth/Cell)
Capabilities
Channel
Longitude
Latitude

Number of Observations

From which the Network can be plotted onto a map, and distance from other points can be calculated.

Can filter the Database to find Open Networks within a given radius of some point. With results fed through Google Maps or an API with similar features.
Free and Open Access Points can be used to remotely run server nodes. (a VPN via a RaspberryPi-ZeroW, for example; though considering a public network is somewhere you would generally want to USE a VPN, it may have a limited use case as an exit node)
