# Wardriving
My experiences with Wardriving

I began Wardriving in late November of 2018 as part of a college research project for a class on Wireless Networks.
For the purposes of my presentation I created an account for WiGLE and I have been using this same account for all of my Wardriving since out of simplicity.

On the morning of December 7th 2018, according to the record from my presentaion slides, I had:
Discovered WiFi Networks with GPS: 14,938
Seen WiFi Networks: 31,835
&&
Discovered Cells with GPS: 276
Seen Cells: 296

As of Feb 4th, 2020; I have:
Discovered WiFi + GPS: 136,728
Seen WiFi Networks: 266,509
Discovered Cell + GPS: 3249
Seen Cell: 5335
Discovered BT + GPS: 95844
Seen BT: 97269

*For the sake of not DOXING myself, I will not include the powerpoint within this git repository.*
**Discovered meaning first WiGLE user to Upload data about the network.
***I only scan for Bluetooth devices with an older Tablet Device.
